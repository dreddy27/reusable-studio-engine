# ROADMAP — start ritual for every new assignment

1. Define intent + constraints in plain language before writing code.
2. Describe the system in words (signal, parameter, behavior, readability test).
3. Build the smallest working version that visibly proves the system runs.
4. Run visible tests (can I understand it in 5 seconds?).
5. Capture process evidence (screenshots + changelog notes).
6. Polish only after meaning is legible.
7. Deploy and confirm the public link works on another device/browser.

Checklist when starting:
- [ ] Charter written first
- [ ] One signal chosen
- [ ] Canvas loop running
- [ ] Input affects behavior
- [ ] Screenshots saved in /process/screenshots
- [ ] Live URL works
