# SYSTEM CHARTER — reusable-studio-engine

Intent:
Build small, legible interactive systems where one input signal clearly shapes one behavior.

Constraints (I will not break these):
1. One signal only in the template sketch.
2. One dominant behavior only.
3. One visual form only (dot, ring, line, or simple sigil).

Tensions I want to hold:
- Signal / Noise
- Order / Drift

Taste vow:
I refuse to hide weak ideas behind overproduced effects.

Template sketch definition:
- Signal: mouse X position
- Parameter: ring radius
- Behavior: ring pulse speed increases as radius increases
- Readability test: moving left to right should make pulse speed clearly faster within 5 seconds

Personal notes for each new assignment:
- Meaning I want to carry:
- What I want people to feel in 10 seconds:
- What I will intentionally leave out:
